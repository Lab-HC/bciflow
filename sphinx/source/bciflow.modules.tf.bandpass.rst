Bandpass Filtering
===========================
Bandpass filtering is a technique used to isolate specific frequency 
ranges within a signal. In the context of EEG data, bandpass filters 
are essential for extracting frequency bands of interest, such as alpha 
(8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), or gamma (30-50 Hz), while attenuating 
frequencies outside the desired range.
